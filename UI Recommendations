Interface Breakdown for Jason:


Descriptive: 
	Player object(.PNG) no animations needed, relative position locked.
	Background(.PNG) no animations needed. Scaled to same size as all other background elements.
	Textbox(UI+graphics) UI element in TS with matching dimension/position graphical element(basically a textbox object with a styled textbox image in the back). Need a “reveal” type animation if possible, so it simulates the experience of reading(optional)
	Button(UI) “Continue On” button, no need to hook up with behavior I will make it send an endpoint to Ed’s engine.

Environmental: 
	Player object(.PNG) no animations needed, relative position locked(left)
“Fountain of Youth”(.PNG), “shining” preferred, optional animation, relative position locked(center)
	Background(.PNG) no animations needed. Scaled to same size as all other background elements.
	Textbox(UI+graphics) UI element in TS with matching dimension/position graphical element(basically a textbox object with a styled textbox image in the back). Need a “reveal” type animation if possible, so it simulates the experience of reading(optional)
	Button1(UI) “Accept” button, no need to hook up with behavior
	Button2(UI) “Decline” button, no need to hook up with behavior
	Dice(This will be implemented later, so don’t make this. This is a hidden element that’s invisible at the start of the event, will become visible once the player clicks accept) Dice has a button underneath that says “Roll”, OR the physical dice doesn’t exist, we simply have a button “Roll Dice” which changes into a numerical value displayed in the same box once pressed.
	
Item_Drop:
	Player object(.PNG) no animations needed, relative position locked(left)
Polymorphic Item(.PNG), “Oscillate” animation needed, relative position locked(center). The PNG changes based on the item type pulled by LLM(We have options here, it could be a dynamically assigned image file or it could just be 4 different copies of the script, either way is simple to implement with the former being slightly more elegant).
(Optional for item)
If critical failure on dice roll, item disappears.
If critical success on dice roll, item shines.
	Background(.PNG) no animations needed. Scaled to same size as all other background elements.
	Textbox(UI+graphics) UI element in TS with matching dimension/position graphical element(basically a textbox object with a styled textbox image in the back). Need a “reveal” type animation if possible, so it simulates the experience of reading(optional)
	Button1(UI) “Accept” button, no need to hook up with behavior
	Button2(UI) “Decline” button, no need to hook up with behavior
